Grant "Teaching Styles"

	Teaching young children has always been a passion of mine. As a teacher, it is very important to teach using a variety of techniques and styles to grasp understanding from all your students.

	My Grant is going to look at the different teaching styles and how they impact students. I want to make this an interactive network analysis that connects the different teaching styles to one another and to the different learning styles of students. 

	The five most common teaching styles include, authority (lecture), demonstrator, facilitator, delegator, and hybrid. All the listed learning styles are commonly used by teachers every day in the classroom. Each teaching style is specific and unique to how it’s demonstrated.

	My project would display a headline saying, “Common Teaching Styles” and then going off the headline will be five bubbles titles each teaching styles. The user will be able to click on each learning style to read a description. From there the user can swipe through to read more about the advantages and disadvantages. As they continue to swipe, connections will be made between the teaching style talked about and the other one talked about within the project. There will be pictures and shorts video embedded to display examples of how each teaching style can be used.
	
	This project would benefit teachers that teach all grade levels to learn about different teaching styles. Additionally, comprehending the impact of their teaching styles, how to incorporate other teaching styles, and the pros and cons of each teaching style will become clear to the project user.
