I am a senior at Christopher Newport Univeristy, in [Newport News, Virginia](https://www.newport-news.org/). I am majoring in social work with a minor in Childhood Studies. After completing undergrad, I plan on pursuing a Master's Degree in Teaching.

For as long as I can remember I wanted to pursue a career in teaching. I can't wait to become a light in lives of my students. Being a teacher involves much more than just educating the future generation. I want to be a role model to my students and allow the opportunity for them to gain social, emotional, and cognitive skills.

At first, I took this class to fulfill the writing intensive requirement, but as I attend more classes I become more and more interested in DH. Being able to communicate via social media platforms and to be able to create digital projects that are interactive are necessary skills within our evolving digital society.


I am the **youngest** of three and the only daughter. I grew up in Northern Virginia where I have lived in the same house my entire life. 

Growing up there was a variety of pets within my household. From birds, to fish to cats and dogs. My _favorite_ animal is and always has been a dog. Shortly after I turned 21 I became a **dog mom** to my puppy, Mandi. Mandi is a 47-pound labradoodle who loves to play ball and has more energy than any other living thing.
