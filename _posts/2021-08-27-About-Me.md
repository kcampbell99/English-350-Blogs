I am a senior at Christopher Newport Univeristy, in Newport news, Virginia. I am majoring in social work with a minor in Childhood Studies. Aftercompleting my undergraduate I plan on pursuing a Master's Degree in Teaching.


At first I took this class to fufill the writing intesive requirement, but as I attend more classes I become more and more interesed in DH. Being able to communicate via social media platfroms and to be able to create digital projects that are interactive are necessary skills within our evolving digital society.


I am the **youngest** of three and the only daughter. I grew up in Northern Virginia where I have lived in the same house my whole life. 

Grwoing up there was a variety of pets iwthin my household. From birds, to fish to cats and dogs. My favortie animal is always has been a dog. Shortyl after I turned 21 I became a **dog mom** to my puppy, Mandi. Mandi is a 47 pound labradoddle who loves to play ball and has more energy then any other living things.
