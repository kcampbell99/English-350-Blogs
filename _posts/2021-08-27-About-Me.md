I am a senior at Christopher Newport Univeristy, in Newport news, Virginia. I am majoring in social work with a minor in Childhood Studies. Aftercompleting my undergraduate I plan on pursuing a Master's Degree in Teaching.


At first I took this class to fufill the writing intesive requirement, but as I atten more classes I become more and more interesed in DH. Being able to communicate via social media platfroms and to be able to create digital projects that are interactive are necessary skills within our evolving digital society.
