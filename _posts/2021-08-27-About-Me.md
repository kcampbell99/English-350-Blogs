I am a senior at Christopher Newport Univeristy, in [Newport News, Virginia](https://www.newport-news.org/). I am majoring in social work with a minor in Childhood Studies. After completing my undergrad, I will be continuing my education to get my Master's Degree in Teaching.

For as long as I can remember I wanted to pursue a career in teaching. I can't wait to become a light in lives of my students. Being a teacher involves much more than just educating the future generation. I want to be a role model to my students and allow the opportunity for them to gain social, emotional, and cognitive skills.

At first, I took this class to fulfill the writing intensive requirement, but as I attend more classes I become more and more interested in DH. It is important to be able to communicate efficiantly via social media platforms and to be able to create digital projects within our evolving digital society.

I am the **youngest** of three and the only daughter. I grew up in Northern Virginia where I have lived in the same house my entire life. 

Throughout my childhood there was a variety of pets within my household. From birds, to fish, to cats and dogs. My _favorite_ animal is and always has been a dog. Shortly after I turned 21, I became a **dog mom** to my puppy, Mandi. Mandi is a 47-pound labradoodle who loves to play ball and has more energy than any other living thing.

I enjoy the summer months the most. My family goes boating often and takes family beach trips to OBX every summer. I love spending time outside soaking up the sun. Knowing this about myself, I plan on moving to a warmer state in the south.

Whenever given the chance, I love to **travel the world**. It is fascinating to imurse oneself into new cultures and experience differnt excursions throughout the world. I have traveled all over Europe and Central America. Of all the places I've visited, Guatemala was the most memorable.

I have been to Guatemala twice. Both times were mission trips to engage and support individuals within the community. Guatemala is a beautiful country. The people I met gave me a different perspective on life. The Guatemalans I met consistantly exemplified tha tthe greatest gift in life is family and friends, not materialistics things.
