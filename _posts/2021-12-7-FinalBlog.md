## *What DH is to Me*

After taking the class I understand the field of Digital Humanities (DH) as the combination of research within a topic of
humanities and digitalizing the content to make it interactive for a target audience. Digital Humanities involves the 
in-depth learning and analysis of traditional humanities (history, philosophy, literature, etc.) through hands-on aspects 
using technology. Instead of just reading about the topic, digital humanities includes interactive maps, quizzes, videos, 
and or audio aspects to allow the user to further engage with the content. Digital Humanities is a continuously evolving 
field as technology continues to advance. 

## *Readings*

Within the first ten weeks of class, we had multiple readings each week. At first, I thought this was going to be very
overwhelming and unnecessary for this class. To my surprise not only did I enjoy majority of the readings, but many 
of them were informative and aided my writing ability. Many of the readings gave points on how to remain concise and 
short when writing, something I have struggled with. 

The reading _Shitty First Drafts_ explained the benefits of writing the first draft. My first drafts consist of word vomit to 
make sure all of my thoughts and ideas are written down. Later on, I take time to form my thoughts properly. I related a lot 
to this article because my first drafts are never my best work and always have room for improvement, which _Shitty First Drafts_
deems as okay. Reading this article gave me validation and a lot more confidence of my own writing.

## *My Favorite Project*

I enjoyed the various projects our class did throughout the semester but my favorite project by far was the completing the CNU map.
Not only was it an enjoyable way to relive my freshman and sophomore years, but it also allowed me to learn how to use 
ThingLink. Incorporating photos, videos, and sounds was an easy process through this software. The map was very 
interactive as it allowed the user to click on different areas around campus to understand the importance of each spot 
for me personally. I loved the final outcome of my project so much I’d like to share it again! Click below

I know this project isn’t required each semester but it was an enjoyable assignment, so I recommend assigning it to 
future students in English 350!

## *DH Project Reviews*

When Dr. Stover first mentioned each student will be critiquing two DH projects throughout the semester I was concerned. I
assumed the DH projects that were already published were perfect. I learned that I was incorrect, every project has room for
improvement based on usability, content included, and the overall layout. I appreciated that we got to pick a DH project 
from a preconceived list for the first review because I had no idea where to find a qualified DH project.

By the time the second review came around, I felt confident enough to find a project that wasn’t too big or too small to critique. 
Writing my reviews I felt bad because I know the time and effort individuals took in creating each DH project. It made me realize 
that critiques are actually beneficial because it does point of flaws but those flaws can be improved on. Additionally, 
writing about the positive aspects of the projects in each review allowed for strengths to be highlighted.

## *Grant Project Overview*

When the final Grant project was first introduced I was very confused on how each part would be created and then flow all
together as one. Separating the Grant project into three separate parts, allowed for quality time and effort ot be spent 
on all aspects of the project. 

The peer reviews were very helpful because my peers pointed out problems that I didn’t even
notice. Also, the specific questions on each peer review sheet made it clear what important aspects to focus on while 
critiquing. The peer reviews allowed another set of eyes and different perspective to see my work, Overall, the peer 
reviews advanced the quality of my project. 

## *Personal Gains from This Class*

Considering this class was writing-intensive, there was a lot of focus on advancing our individual writing skills. 
Personally, I improved as a writer, by being able to be more concise and to the point when writing. I feel more confident
in my writing when I have completed multiple drafts because the first draft is just a part of the writing process. 

Through the various projects and assignments, I have learned multiple different styles of writing, like blog posts, short Twitter
posts, and Grant proposals. There are multiple forms of writing, all that require various lengths, this class helped me understand 
you can format writing in other ways besides a long essay.
