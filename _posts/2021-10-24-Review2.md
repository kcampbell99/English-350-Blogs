"The Roaring Twenties" DH project is currently a draft that is under review. This project aims to recreate the environemnt in New York 
City in the late 1920s. The Roaring Twenties was a wild time with constant noise throughout the streets. Many people complained of the noises from others through filing complaints, newsreels, and writing letters to the Mayor and Comission of Health. Throughout this site the location, descritpiton, and auditory of the noise complaints can be explored.

There are five buttons that take the user to different parts of the project. Clicking the "Intro" button allows the user to read about the in depth description of the project's purpose. Within the "Sound" button there are many sources of inner city noises that recieved complaints during the Roaring Twenties. There is a timeline of the occurance of the types o fnoise complaints when the user clicks the "Time" button. The "Info" button provides background knowledge of different aspects of the project. The button "Space" places the noise complaints on a modern and 1933 map of NYC to specify the location of each.
