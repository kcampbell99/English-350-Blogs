## Introduction
"The Roaring Twenties" Digitl Humanities project is currently a draft that is under review. This project aims to recreate the environemnt in New York City in the late 1920s. The Roaring Twenties was a wild time with consistant noise throughout the streets. The purpose of this project is for users to learn about the noise issues through various, submitted complaints, newsreels, and written letters to the Mayor and Comission of Health. Throughout this site the location, descritpiton, and auditory of varying noise complaints can be explored. These feature allow the user to gain a better understanding of the noises throughout NYC during this time in history and the disturbances caused.

## Credits
The original version of this project was completed by Emily Thopson and Scott Mahoy. Since then it has been revised by Emily Thompson and Ben Johnston. The draft of this project claims two many author but had many others working behind the scenes. Within the acknowledgements section, experts, editors, and supporters of the project were recognized.



## Design
There are five buttons that take the user to different parts of the project. Clicking the "Intro" button allows the user to read about the in depth description of the project's purpose. Within the "Sound" button there are many sources of inner city noises that recieved complaints during the Roaring Twenties. There is a timeline of the occurance of the types of noise complaints when the user clicks the "Time" button. The "Info" button provides background knowledge of different aspects of the project. The button "Space" places the noise complaints on a modern and 1933 map of NYC to specify the location of each.

The project is accesible on desktop, laptop and smart phones. Not matter how the user chooses to access this project, it is easy to navigate through it's entirety. 

The zoom feature is very helpful on the map. This allows the user to be able to focus on a certain location in New York City. Additionally, since the icons are very close to one another so being able to zoom in allows focus on each icon.

## Maps

There are two maps for the user to flip between, a modern map and a map from 1933. On both map icons are placed to represent the location of received noise complaints. Including maps does create a visual representation, but the modern map is unnecessary because the content is from the Roaring Twenties. The 1933 map is reminiscent of topography, which is beneficial to the user.

## Button Features
Under the "info" tab there is a historical narrative that describes the Roaring Twenties in great detail. Although this has potential to benfically aid the project, the font is very blurry and impossible to read. The quality needs to be improved in order for the user to be able to read the content and benefit from it.

The "Time" button chronologically sorts each noise complaint by the date. This is a positive feature that gives context to all the noise complaints in time relation to one another. It also paints a mental picture of the order of those complaints through NYC during the Roaring Twenties.

The "Sound" tab seems very unnecessary because the content could be included under the appropriate icons on the map. By clicking on the objects in the list, the user can select from noise complaints relating to that noise maker or videos. The noise complaints and related information is already provided on the map since all the noise complaints are displayed. Embedding the relatable videos into some of the related icons on the map would allow accessiblity of all information in one concised area.

## Conclusion
This is just a draft of the project but it is organized in an excellent manner. Embedding a map, timeline, videos, descriptions, and sources of the noise complaints clearly depict the audio disturbance during this period. This project effectively exploits the noise complaints that occured in NYC during the Roaring Twenties.
