# Special Spots on Campus

Christopher Newport University is only two and a half hours away from my hometown but since the first day of freshman year it has felt like home. The unique architecture and gorgeous great lawn are eye candy when you are walking around campus.

Half way through my college experience the entire world went into lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic. On March 14, 2020 when we got sent home I knew that was the end of my “normal” college experience. I love CNU and everything it has to offer but for my remaining two years I knew they were going to look a lot different. I was nothing short of correct, my junior year I took class fully online while staying home in northern virginia. Although I knew I wasn’t missing much, because Covid ended many activities and social gatherings, I missed just being on campus. It is still not fully “normal” on campus during my senior year but I am more than thrilled to be back in Newport News.
    
The first two and last years of college looked a lot different for me. Therefore, I chose to tell my CNU story through the lens of my freshman and sophomore year. College life before the pandemic involved spending lots of time in Regattas dining hall, attending football games, and spending endless time with friends in the dorms and on the great lawn. 
  
I have so many stories and cherishable memories throughout the (ongoing) four years of my college life. I choose to tell the story of my first two years in college since I was always on campus. The spots I choose to point out around campus hold significant value to my first two years of college. They are either tied with unforgettable memories or had a positive impact on me as an individual.

Creating my CNU map was a lot of fun because it allowed me to revisit past photos and videos that display memories. Writing the descriptions of each place was a challenge because there are so many different memories and experiences that could be added. I had a lot of trouble thinking of a 10th spot to pinpoint on my map, I think because CNU’s campus is so small I had to think outside of the box. 

When deciding what icons and colors to use I mainly was focused on it being colorful and visually appealing. There are only a few icon images that properly represent the spot pointed out. The two house icons were selected because those two building are where I resided freshman and sophomore year. The library is labeled by a book to exemplify all the reading and studying that took place. The last meaningful icon is the heart for the Great Lawn because of all locations on campus this is definitely my go to place.
  
I am so thankful that the technology was easy to work with because I was dreading getting frustrated with it. To add wording or different media was a lot simpler than I expected. I really enjoy using the ThingLink program and recreating my freshman and sophomore year at CNU!
