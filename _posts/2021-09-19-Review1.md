There are over 500,000 coins within the Munzkabinett Berlin collection. The Coin project allows for 26,000 of those coins to be explored. Choosing which coins within the collection should be put on display in the Munzkabinett Berlin Museum is challenging. The digital interaction allows users to learn and interact with these coins which otherwise they don’t have the option to do. Of all these historical coin options, only 26,000 coins are chosen to be incorporated in the museum. The project allows the user to sort the coins into a variety of categories and learn about their history and importance. 

This was a huge project to complete. The amount of data, time, and knowledge needed to complete the Coin project is insane. Compiling nine different properties and many supplementary details about 26,000 coins required a lot of teamwork and patience. This project required seven individuals and their expertise to come together to complete the Coin project. There was one individual responsible for the design and development. Two others completed the research and ideation. One individual supervised the completion of the project over time, while three additional individuals consulted throughout the whole process. The project was created using PixiJS, d3, and React. 

The home screen displays all 26,000 coins in a ginormous pile. When you click on each individual coin it gives you the following information on the preview screen; it’s name, the country it originates from, the region, the minting place, the time period, the material, the weight, and the diameter. This information provides a picture to be painted of each coins’ atrributes. At first glance, in the preview screen, you see eight characteristics of each coin, but are given the option to click “view in collection”. This option takes the user to the Munzkabinett online catalogue that includes detailed information about the coin and its’ historical relevance.

Furthermore, by selecting one or two properties at the bottom of the screen, the coins get separated into groups. It allows the user to compare and contrast these coins to one another based on defining characteristics. When you first pick the distinctive properties it makes separate piles of the coins, and you are able to scroll around the screen to see each pile. This is interesting because before you look at the coins individually, you can get an idea of how many coins share specific characteristics. The smaller the pile, the more unique the coins are from one another. An issue with this is if there is a huge pile it is near impossible to click on every coin in the pile.

When the user sorts the coins amongst the different properties, it “piles” them together, very closely. Each coin within the pile looks the same, with only four varying shades of gold and silver. When separated into the piles, the coins are placed very close together and on top of one another, therefore, it is hard to select each coin without repeating or missing a coin. 
	
The site does allow the user to zoom in and out with relative ease. The issue is when you zoom in on a specific coin, it becomes blurry, leaving the coins’ face to be practically unidentifiable. To add more context and detail, it would benefit the project to display a photograph of the actual coin on the preview screen (before you select “view in collection”).	
  
The biggest problem with this project is it is very complicated to go back and find the exact coin you were looking at previously. If you are clicking around, reading about properties of multiple coins, but then want to return to a certain one, it is near impossible. Unless the user notes two very distinctive properties and is able to make a small enough pile, then click through all the coins in the sorted pile to find the exact same one, you will never find the same coin again. Within the project, there should be a search option to insert the coin’s name in order to easily find the same coin. 

This is a very interesting project but it is a little overwhelming and could be organized in a better manner. There needs to be a search option to be able to narrow down all the data when looking for a specific coin. The fact that this project is so interactive, while being educational, is enjoyable for the user.
